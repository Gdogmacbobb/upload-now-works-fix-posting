“Stop general fixes. Do this exact sequence to restore the app quickly and identify the blocker. Do not refactor anything outside the steps.

A) Route Hijack → Known-Good Placeholder

Temporarily map /login-screen to a minimal, self-contained placeholder screen defined in the same file that declares the routes (to avoid any cross-file import side effects).

The placeholder must render a SafeArea + Scaffold + big text: LOGIN PLACEHOLDER — ROUTE OK.

Keep splash as-is (3s timer → /login-screen).

Rebuild and show console logs from splash timer fire through first frame of the placeholder.

Goal: If the placeholder renders, routing is healthy and the bug lives inside the real LoginScreen file or its imports.

B) If the placeholder renders → Binary-Search the Real LoginScreen

Swap /login-screen back to the real LoginScreen, but wrap its entire build in a try/catch that prints the exception and returns a Safe fallback saying: LOGIN FALLBACK — EXCEPTION CAUGHT.

If fallback triggers, print the full exception + stack with file & line.

Binary search the imports/sections of LoginScreen:

Start with just a Scaffold + one Text.

Add imports back one by one (GoogleFonts, theme, validators, controllers, Supabase helpers, custom widgets).

After each add, rebuild and confirm which add causes the crash.

When the crashing dependency is found, apply a minimal surgical fix (move async calls out of top-level/build, guard platform calls on web, replace global singletons with lazy init, etc.).

Restore the full LoginScreen and prove it renders.

C) If the placeholder does NOT render

Print the effective route table at runtime (all keys) and the exact string used by splash to navigate.

Add a global onUnknownRoute that logs the unknown name and pushes the placeholder so the app can’t freeze.

Rebuild and show logs proving the placeholder appears.

D) Evidence I Need (don’t skip)

Logs with these markers:
[SPLASH] Timer fired, [NAV] to /login-screen, [ROUTER] resolving /login-screen, [LOGIN] building… or [LOGIN] fallback exception: …

One screenshot or text render of what appears after splash.

The single import/section identified (if any) that caused the crash, and the exact fix applied.

Rules:

No broad refactors.

No theme/router rewrites.

Touch only: route map, Splash → Login navigation, LoginScreen file.

Keep Supabase calls out of LoginScreen build; any IO must be in initState with guards.

Deliverable: App launches → Splash (3s) → visible login UI or placeholder. Include logs and the precise root cause.”**

Rebuild my Flutter web app from scratch with a minimal, crash-safe 4-screen navigation flow. Remove ALL legacy/branding splash logic and make sure it always loads fresh (no service workers, no cache issues).

Requirements:

Screens & Flow

PresplashScreen: black screen with [PRESPLASH] text. Show 1 second then auto-navigate to /splash.

StatueSplashScreen: black screen with my asset assets/YNFNY_Logo.png (height 200) and orange text "You Not From New York". Show 3 seconds then auto-navigate to /login.

LoginScreen: black background, one button "Login â†’ Discovery". On tap navigate to /discovery.

DiscoveryScreen: black background with white "Discovery Feed" text.

Routes & Navigation

Initial route = /presplash.

Routes map: /presplash, /splash, /login, /discovery.

Use Navigator.pushReplacementNamed for all transitions.

Debug Logging (must match exactly)

[APP] main() started

[PRESPLASH] initState()

[PRESPLASH] timer fired â†’ navigating

[NAV] pushReplacementNamed(/splash)

[SPLASH] initState()

[SPLASH] timer fired â†’ navigating

[NAV] pushReplacementNamed(/login)

[LOGIN] initState()

[LOGIN] navigation success â†’ Discovery

[DISCOVERY] initState()

Crash-Safety

Add _hasNavigated flags to prevent double navigation.

Add if (mounted) checks before navigation.

Add backup timers: 1.5s for presplash, 3.5s for splash.

Remove all service worker logic from index.html and add:

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => {
    for (let r of regs) { r.unregister(); }
    console.log('[SW] Service worker unregistered');
  });
}


Assets

Standardize logo path: assets/YNFNY_Logo.png.

Update pubspec.yaml to include it.

Build & Deploy

Run flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build web.

Ensure index.html, manifests, and bootstrap are clean.

Verify HTTP 200s for assets.

ðŸ“‹ Final Outcome:
When I open the app in browser I should see:
Presplash (1s) â†’ Statue splash (3s) â†’ Login â†’ Discovery.
With the exact debug logs, no branding splash, no infinite loops, no cache issues.

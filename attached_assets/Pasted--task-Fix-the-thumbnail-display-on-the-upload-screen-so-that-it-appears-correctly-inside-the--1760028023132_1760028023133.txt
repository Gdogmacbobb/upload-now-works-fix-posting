      "preview_button": {
        "description": "A unified preview button (85% width, 4:5 aspect ratio) that shows a paused VideoPlayer frame as the thumbnail background with a play icon and duration badge.",

    "issue_observed": "The thumbnail currently appears in a separate container below the preview button, leaving the preview button itself black or empty instead of displaying the default frame. This creates the appearance of two different thumbnail displays.",

    "goal": "Display the default thumbnail (first video frame) directly within the preview button container on upload, replacing the black background. Keep the Select Thumbnail button for manual updates. Remove any separate thumbnail box below the preview button while maintaining all existing upload and preview functionality."

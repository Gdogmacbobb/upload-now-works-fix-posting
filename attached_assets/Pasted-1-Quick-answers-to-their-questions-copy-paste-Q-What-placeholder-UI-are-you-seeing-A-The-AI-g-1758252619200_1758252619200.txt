1) Quick answers to their questions (copy/paste)

Q: What placeholder UI are you seeing?
A: The AI-generated “generic YNFNY” UI (rounded orange logo, simplified login, generic account chooser). Please delete every file that introduced this look and revert to my authentic UI.

Q: Is this a different/newer version?
A: Yes. The correct version is the one that existed right before I asked for “Phase 6” (the big features prompt). That’s the newest authentic UI I want.

Q: Re-upload the zip?
A: I’ve uploaded the archive again. Use it only to restore my UI files. Do not touch Supabase keys, tables, RLS, or real data.

2) Paste-ready, single message prompt for your coding agent

BEGIN PROMPT

Goal (non-negotiable): Replace any AI-generated UI with my authentic YNFNY UI exactly as it was just before the “Phase 6” prompt, while preserving Supabase setup, env, and data.

Source of truth

Use the zip I uploaded (the most recent ynfny*.zip) as the canonical UI.

If there’s a conflict, prefer the UI from that zip or the files that existed pre-Phase-6 in the repo.

Keep these EXACT edits/features:

3-tab bottom nav (left→right):
Search | Camera (Performers) or Community (New Yorkers) | Profile (acts as “Home”).

Registration differences: Performer vs New Yorker forms remain different.

Buttons: Camera button for performers, Community button for New Yorkers, Edit button on Performer profile.

Do/Don’t lists (very important)

✅ You may modify / overwrite:

lib/presentation/** (screens)

lib/widgets/** (UI widgets)

lib/theme/** (colors/typography)

assets/** (logos, icons, images)

lib/router/** or wherever routing/nav is defined to enforce the 3-tab layout

pubspec.yaml (only to add missing UI deps & assets)

⛔ Do NOT modify, delete, or rotate keys for:

lib/services/** (Supabase/auth/video/user/donation services)

supabase/** (SQL, migrations, RLS)

.env, .env.local, .env.production, or any secrets

.replit, replit.yaml, replit.nix

Any config that would change Supabase project, tables, or data

Clean out the fake UI

Remove any screens/widgets/assets that were introduced by the agent and do not exist in my archive (common tell: generic orange square logo login, “auto-generated TikTok feed” comments).

Where names collide, use the versions from my archive.

Routing & navigation (lock this in)

Ensure app entry shows my authentic presplash → Statue splash → login flow.

Bottom nav = 3 tabs in this exact order:

Search

Camera if role=performer else Community

Profile (and this is the Home button)

Profile routes to Performer or New Yorker profile by account type (UI may be same for now but route differs).

Pubspec & build fixes (Flutter 3.32 / Dart 3.8 web)

Add dependency to fix Matrix4/Vector3 missing errors:

dependencies:
  vector_math: ^2.1.4


Then run flutter pub get.

Ensure no dependency_overrides remove vector_math.

Keep service worker behavior as default Flutter web or unregister if a custom SW was added by the agent (black screens). Don’t touch my Supabase config.

Assets & branding

Make sure pubspec.yaml lists all authentic assets from the archive (logos, icons, splash).

Remove any AI-added placeholder assets.

Verification steps (must complete)

Print a file change summary (paths added/removed/modified).

Run flutter analyze and flutter build web – fix UI-level issues.

Launch the dev server on 0.0.0.0:5000 (no service worker caching).

Navigate and confirm visually:

Login matches my authentic screenshots (not the generic orange square login).

Account type chooser shows Performer vs New Yorker with my copy & layout.

Bottom nav is exactly 3 tabs (Search | Camera/Community | Profile).

Performer profile shows Edit button.

Post the 3 screenshots: Login, Account Type, Performer Profile, and the console log line with the 3-tab labels.

If conflict persists

Create a backup folder backup_ai_ui/ with the removed AI-generated files (so nothing is lost), but keep the running app on my authentic UI.

Deliverable: Running app using my real UI, 3-tab nav enforced, registration differences preserved, Supabase untouched. Include the change summary + screenshots.

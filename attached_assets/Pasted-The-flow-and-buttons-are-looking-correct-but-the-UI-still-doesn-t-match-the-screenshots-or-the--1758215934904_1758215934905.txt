The flow and buttons are looking correct, but the **UI still doesnâ€™t match the screenshots** or the authentic YNFNY design. I need you to **fully restore the UI styling** across all screens, using the screenshots I uploaded as references AND including the edits we already made together. Right now, the appâ€™s backend/auth/navigation looks solid, but the UI is still off.

ðŸ“Œ Do not change the Supabase integration or navigation logic.
ðŸ“Œ Do not reset the progress weâ€™ve made on tasks (sign-in fixes, navigation test, storage, following feed data).
ðŸ“Œ Only update the UI so that it looks exactly like the screenshots with the custom edits we made.

ðŸ”‘ Apply these requirements:

1. **Navigation**
   - 4-tab layout: Following | Search | Camera (performers) or Community (New Yorkers) | Profile
   - Account type detection: performers see Camera, New Yorkers see Community
   - Profile button should route to performer_profile_screen.dart vs newyorker_profile_screen.dart (for now both can look the same)

2. **Registration Differences**
   - Performer registration: extra fields (performance type, location, bio, social links)
   - New Yorker registration: simpler form, routes to main app with Community in bottom nav

3. **Profile Pages**
   - Performer profile: must include Edit button + expanded stats (earnings, followers, donations, etc.)
   - New Yorker profile: for now, same look, but community button in nav replaces camera

4. **Support Performer Page**
   - Apple Pay, Google Pay, card entry
   - Quick messages for encouragement

5. **Video Upload (Performers only)**
   - Caption, hashtags, performance type, location picker, privacy settings

6. **UI Styling**
   - Dark theme, orange #FF8C00 accents
   - Rounded buttons, clean input fields
   - Consistent padding and professional layout
   - Donation buttons should pop with bright orange

ðŸš¨ Important:
- Do not undo the progress from the implementation plan (auth flow, bottom nav fixes, Supabase queries).
- Restore the UI faithfully to screenshots + edits.
- After restoration, continue the pending tasks in the task list.

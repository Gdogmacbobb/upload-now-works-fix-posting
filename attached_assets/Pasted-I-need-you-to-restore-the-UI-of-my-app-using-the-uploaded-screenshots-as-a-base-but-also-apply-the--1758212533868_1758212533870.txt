I need you to restore the UI of my app using the uploaded screenshots as a base, but also apply the specific edits we had already made after those screenshots.

ðŸ“Œ General Rules:
- Use the screenshots as visual references only (colors, layout, spacing).
- Re-apply all post-screenshot edits we implemented together.
- Keep Supabase logic, auth flow, and navigation intact â€” only fix UI.

ðŸ”‘ Critical Edits to Apply:
1. Registration Flow:
   - New Yorker registration: standard signup fields + routes user to main app with **Community button** on bottom navigation.
   - Performer registration: includes additional fields (performance type, location, bio, social links) + routes user to main app with **Camera button** on bottom navigation.

2. Navigation Differences:
   - New Yorker bottom nav: Home, Following, Search, **Community**, Profile.
   - Performer bottom nav: Home, Following, Search, **Camera**, Profile.

3. Performer Profile Page:
   - Must include **Edit Profile button** for updating bio, schedule, social links.
   - Keep expanded stats section (earnings, donations, followers, performance schedule).

4. Discovery & Following Feeds:
   - Both screens remain TikTok-style vertical feeds.
   - Following feed pulls data based on userâ€™s follows.
   - Discovery shows trending content.

5. Support Performer Page:
   - Must include Apple Pay / Google Pay / Credit Card options.
   - Keep quick messages feature for sending encouragement.

6. Video Upload (Performer Only):
   - Camera upload feature tied to performer account type.
   - Include caption, hashtags, performance type, location selector, privacy settings.

7. UI Consistency:
   - Dark theme with orange accents throughout.
   - Rounded buttons, modern input fields, consistent padding.
   - Keep donation buttons styled in bright orange.

ðŸš¨ Important:
- Do not remove or reset Supabase integration.
- Do not touch service worker or navigation logic.
- Apply edits consistently across both iOS and web preview.
- After restoring UI, continue pending tasks in the list (sign-in fixes, navigation test, media storage, following feed data).

The app navigation and Supabase integration are mostly correct, but the UI is wrong. I need you to restore the UI to match the real YNFNY design.

📌 Instructions:
1. Use the uploaded screenshots as the base reference for the visual design of each screen (colors, layout, fonts, buttons, styling). 
2. After applying the base designs, re-apply the edits and improvements that were made after those screenshots:
   - Use the updated color scheme (dark theme with orange highlights).
   - Keep the improved spacing, rounded buttons, and modern input fields we already edited.
   - Maintain the donation/support flow we polished with Apple Pay/Google Pay and quick messages.
   - Maintain the improved profile stats section (earnings, followers, donations).
   - Keep the navigation bar we updated (Home, Following, Search, Profile tabs).
3. Do not touch navigation logic or Supabase integration — only update UI.
4. Make sure every screen matches the reference design + our previous edits.

📱 Screens to Restore:
- Splash Screen → use “Splash Screen Page.png” as base, apply our improved gradient and animation edits.
- Login Screen → use “Login Page.png” as base, with the dark theme, orange accents, and our edited rounded login button.
- Account Type Selection → use “Account Type Page Part 1–2.png” as base, but keep our updated performer vs. New Yorker toggle styling.
- Account Creation / Registration → use “Account Creation Page Part 1–4.png” as base, but apply our previous edits (improved text fields, styled signup button, metadata fields for performer).
- Handle Creation → use “Handle Creation Screen Page.png” as base, keep orange accent for error messages and confirmation.
- Discovery Feed → use “Discovery Feed Page.png” as base, TikTok-style vertical feed with Supabase integration.
- Following Feed → use “Following Feed Page.png” as base, same vertical feed layout, real Supabase data.
- Performer Page → use “Performer Page Part 1–4.png” as base, but keep our edits:
   * Expanded About tab
   * Performance types & frequent locations
   * Social media links
   * Donation button with orange style
   * Stats section (likes, views, donations)
- Support Performer → use “Support Performer Page Part 1–2.png” as base, with our improved quick messages and Apple Pay/Google Pay buttons.
- User Profile → use “User Profile Page Part 1–3.png” as base, but keep:
   * Stats section (earnings, followers, donations)
   * Activity feed with donations/likes
   * Account settings and preferences sections
- Video Player → use “Video Play Page.png” as base, apply our edit for orange play button.
- Video Upload → use “Video Upload Page Part 1–3.png” as base, but keep:
   * Hashtags/mentions input field
   * Performance type selection (music, dance, etc.)
   * Location selection dropdown
   * Privacy settings (public/followers only)

🚨 Critical:
- Don’t overwrite Supabase logic, navigation flow, or service worker settings.
- Focus ONLY on restoring the UI to the correct style + edits we had.
- After restoring UI, continue with pending tasks (sign-in fixes, navigation test with logging, permanent media storage, following feed data).

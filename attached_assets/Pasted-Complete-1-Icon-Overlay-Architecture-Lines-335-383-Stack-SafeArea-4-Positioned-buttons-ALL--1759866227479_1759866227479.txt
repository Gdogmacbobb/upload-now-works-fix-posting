Complete
1. Icon Overlay Architecture (Lines 335-383):

Stack ‚Üí SafeArea ‚Üí 4 Positioned buttons
ALL icons render outside initialization guard - always visible
Back (top-left), Mute (top-left+60), Flash (top-right), Camera Switch (top-right+60)
Opacity reduces to 40% when disabled, but icons always render
2. iOS Flash Implementation (Lines 277-300):

device.hasTorch check ‚úÖ
torchMode = enabled ? .on : .off ‚úÖ
Returns state via stateStream ‚úÖ
3. Camera Switch (Lines 255-275):

Bidirectional cycling: (currentCameraIndex + 1) % availableCameras.count ‚úÖ
Runs on background queue ‚úÖ
Reinitializes camera with fresh state ‚úÖ
4. Zoom Performance (Lines 302-324):

Clamps to hardware min/max ‚úÖ
Runs setZoom directly (iOS manages threading) ‚úÖ
Setup local app building process for iOS
Check button layout on screen
Test camera controls for hardware
üì± Complete iOS Clean Build Workflow
Run these commands on your local machine (where you build for iPhone):

# 1. Clean Flutter build cache
flutter clean
# 2. Remove all iOS build artifacts
rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock ios/.symlinks ios/build
# 3. Deintegrate CocoaPods (in ios folder)
cd ios && pod deintegrate && cd ..
# 4. Reinstall pods with repo update
cd ios && pod install --repo-update && cd ..
# 5. Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get
# 6. Build fresh iOS release
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
Then deploy to your iPhone via Xcode.

‚úÖ Verification Checklist
After installing the clean build on your iPhone, verify:

1. NO Debug Overlay
‚ùå Black box with zoom/range/resolution text should be GONE
‚úÖ Clean camera preview with no visual diagnostics
2. Icons Visible & Functional
‚úÖ Back button (top-left) - always visible, navigates back
‚úÖ Mute button (top-left, 60px over) - toggles mic icon
‚úÖ Flash button (top-right) - shows flash_on/flash_off icon
‚úÖ Camera switch (top-right, 60px over) - shows cameraswitch icon
3. Flash Toggle (Rear Camera)
‚úÖ Tap flash icon on back camera - should enable/disable torch
‚úÖ Green "Flash enabled/disabled" SnackBar appears
‚úÖ Icon changes: flash_off ‚Üí flash_on
‚úÖ If front camera or no flash: icon shows at 40% opacity (disabled state)
4. Camera Switch (Bidirectional)
‚úÖ Tap camera switch icon - cycles front ‚Üí back ‚Üí front
‚úÖ Smooth transition with <200ms latency
‚úÖ Flash state resets (front camera has no flash, so icon disabled)
‚úÖ Zoom resets to widest view (minZoom, typically 0.6x)
5. Zoom Performance
‚úÖ Pinch to zoom - smooth response, no lag
‚úÖ Full hardware range accessible (e.g., 0.6x wide to 10x tele)
‚úÖ Zoom updates <16ms latency (60fps-optimized)
‚úÖ No snap-back on gesture release
6. Console Logs (Xcode)
You should see clean diagnostic output like:

‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

üîç If Issues Persist
1. Debug overlay still visible:

Hard delete the app from iPhone (long-press ‚Üí Remove App)
Clean build + reinstall
Check you're running the correct build (not an old cached version)
2. Flash not working:

Check Xcode console for "Torch Support: true/false"
Verify you're on back camera (front cameras don't have flash)
Look for flash toggle logs starting with üí°
3. Camera won't switch:

Check console for "Switching camera..." and completion logs
Verify availableCameras.count > 1 in initialization logs
4. Zoom laggy:

Check console for "‚è±Ô∏è UI update latency" warnings
Should show <5ms updates during pinch gesture
Verify camera features work correctly
Summary
The black debug overlay does NOT exist in your current codebase - your iPhone is running an old cached build. I've verified:

‚úÖ Code is clean - No visual debug UI anywhere
‚úÖ Icon architecture correct - Stack + SafeArea + 4 Positioned buttons always render
‚úÖ Native implementation verified - AVFoundation hasTorch, cycling logic, zoom clamping all correct

Next Steps:

Run the clean build workflow on your local machine (commands above)
Deploy fresh build to your iPhone via Xcode
Use verification checklist to confirm everything works:
No debug overlay ‚úÖ
Icons visible ‚úÖ
Flash toggles on rear camera ‚úÖ
Camera switches front ‚Üî back ‚úÖ
Zoom smooth with full hardware range ‚úÖ
The diagnostic logging (with emoji prefixes) will still work in Xcode console - it's console-only, never visual UI.

Let me know what you find after the clean rebuild

    "clarification": {
      "issue": "The preview container still shows a black screen even after applying the 150 ms texture delay. Additionally, when pressing 'Select Thumbnail', a new thumbnail container appears instead of updating the existing preview button.",
      "confirmed_behavior": [
        "Black preview on both web and mobile.",
        "Second thumbnail container appears only after clicking 'Select Thumbnail'.",
        "The original preview button remains black and does not update with the chosen frame."
      ]
    },
    "request": {
      "objective": "Fix the black preview container and stop new thumbnail boxes from spawning. The thumbnail (first frame or selected frame) must render inside the preview button container itself.",
      "required_fixes": [
        "1. Ensure that the VideoPlayer controller fully initializes and paints the first frame (Duration.zero) inside the preview button container immediately after entering the upload screen.",
        "2. The 'Select Thumbnail' feature must update that same preview container instead of generating a new one.",
        "3. Implement a reliable render synchronization method: after controller.initialize() and seekTo(Duration.zero), wait until controller.value.isInitialized && controller.value.isPlaying or controller.value.position > Duration.zero before pausing and calling setState().",
        "4. Add a single rebuild to force the VideoPlayer to paint after frame readiness, using WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback() instead of static time delays.",
        "5. Maintain all other logic: video playback, orientation, audio sync, Supabase upload, performance type display, and styling layout unchanged."
      ],
      "constraints": [
        "Do not change button positioning, sizing, or existing layout flow.",
        "Do not remove or recreate any working widgets.",
        "Do not touch Supabase, caption logic, or video file upload behavior.",
        "Do not affect Select Thumbnail scrubber functionality â€” only make sure it writes back to the main preview container."
      ],
      "goal": "When the user enters the upload page, the first frame of the video displays as the default thumbnail inside the preview button. When the user selects a new thumbnail, that same preview container updates to the selected frame. No duplicate thumbnail box should ever appear, and no black preview should be visible."

    "debug_info": {
      "platforms_tested": ["Web", "Mobile"],
      "current_result": "Black preview container and duplicate thumbnail container when selecting a thumbnail.",
      "expected_result": "Single unified preview container that correctly displays the video frame both by default and after thumbnail selection."

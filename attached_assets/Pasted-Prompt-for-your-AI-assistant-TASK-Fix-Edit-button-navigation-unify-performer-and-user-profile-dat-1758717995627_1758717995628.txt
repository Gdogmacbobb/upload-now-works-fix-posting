TASK: Fix Edit button navigation + unify performer and user profile data

1. Navigation:
   - Update the orange "Edit" button inside performer_profile/widgets/profile_header_widget.dart.
   - OnPressed â†’ must navigate to `UserProfile()` (NOT `/user-profile-edit`, since that route may not exist).
   - Use:
     Navigator.push(
       context,
       MaterialPageRoute(
         builder: (context) => UserProfile(userId: currentUserId),
       ),
     );

2. UserProfile Page:
   - Ensure UserProfile page is styled like the design in the provided screenshots.
   - Must pull data from the same Supabase row as PerformerProfile, so the information is consistent.
   - Fields required:
     â€¢ full_name
     â€¢ handle (username)
     â€¢ role (performer/new_yorker)
     â€¢ bio
     â€¢ profile_image_url
     â€¢ followers_count
     â€¢ video_count
     â€¢ supporter_count (donations)
   - Replace any mock/demo data in user_profile.dart with real Supabase queries.

3. Shared Data Source:
   - Both PerformerProfile and UserProfile must query the same `user_profiles` table, filtered by `id`.
   - Add `userId` parameter to UserProfile constructor to ensure it loads the correct record.
   - Example:
     class UserProfile extends StatefulWidget {
       final String userId;
       const UserProfile({Key? key, required this.userId}) : super(key: key);
     }

4. Supabase SQL Query (always fetch id):
   ```sql
   select
     id,
     full_name,
     username,
     role,
     bio,
     profile_image_url,
     followers_count,
     video_count,
     supporter_count
   from user_profiles
   where id = '<currentUserId>';


Default Profile Image:

If profile_image_url is null, show a simple placeholder avatar instead of "Unknown Performer."

Remove Old Edit Button:

Delete any previous Edit button (like in AppBar of performer_profile.dart).

Only keep the new orange Edit button next to Supporters count.

ðŸ‘‰ This will:
- Make the **Edit button work properly** (takes you to your personal User Profile page).  
- Ensure **User Profile** and **Performer Profile** always show the same real Supabase data.  
- Eliminate mock/demo data.  
- Guarantee `id` is always fetched in the query for ownership checks and edit access.

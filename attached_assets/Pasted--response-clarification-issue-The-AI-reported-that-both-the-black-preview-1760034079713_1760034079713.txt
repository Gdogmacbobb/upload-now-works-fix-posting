  "response": {
    "clarification": {
      "issue": "The AI reported that both the black preview and thumbnail rotation issues were fixed, but the behavior remains unchanged. When entering the upload screen, the preview container still shows a black screen instead of the first frame. After selecting a thumbnail, the frame displays correctly, but if the user watches and closes the preview, the thumbnail rotates or flips. The _primeThumbnail() function and transform cleanup logic exist, but they are not functioning correctly at runtime."
    },
    "request": {
      "objective": "Audit and re-implement the thumbnail initialization and rotation handling so that the preview container immediately shows the first video frame on upload-screen load and the thumbnail always remains upright, even after preview playback. Ensure that all other app features remain fully intact.",
      "required_actions": [
        "1. Perform a runtime check to verify whether _primeThumbnail() actually executes after controller initialization. Add logging or visual indicator to confirm it runs once and only once when entering the upload screen.",
        "2. If the preview still shows black, delay the initialization slightly by awaiting controller.initialize() completely, then call _primeThumbnail(Duration.zero) inside a postFrameCallback to guarantee texture availability before seeking.",
        "3. Extend _primeThumbnail() to re-verify that the frame rendered successfully by checking controller.value.isInitialized and controller.value.isPlaying state after the 180ms play-pause cycle. If the texture fails to render, repeat the seek-play-pause once.",
        "4. Enforce orientation lock with metadata-based rotation. Always store the correct rotation value when the video initializes, and use it for both the preview and the thumbnail wrapper. Do not apply any transform to the shared VideoPlayer element itself.",
        "5. After preview closes, explicitly reset the rotation wrapper and confirm that no residual transforms are present on the video element. For web builds, execute:",
        "   el.style.removeProperty('transform');",
        "   el.style.removeProperty('will-change');",
        "   el.style.removeProperty('rotate');",
        "6. Verify that the same orientation angle is applied consistently in both the preview and upload-screen contexts by keeping one shared orientation variable.",
        "7. Test the full flow:",
        "   • Enter upload screen → first frame appears instantly.",
        "   • Select thumbnail → same container updates with correct frame and orientation.",
        "   • Watch preview and close → thumbnail remains upright and unchanged.",
        "   • No additional containers appear; scrubber, caption, and upload flow all remain intact."
      ],
      "constraints": [
        "Do not change layout structure or UI hierarchy.",
        "Do not modify Supabase functions, upload logic, or backend schema.",
        "Do not alter audio playback, scrubber responsiveness, or caption input.",
        "Ensure compatibility with both web and mobile Flutter builds."
      ],
      "goal": "Eliminate the black screen on upload-screen entry and permanently stabilize the thumbnail orientation so that it always matches the video’s true orientation. Confirm that _primeThumbnail() is truly rendering a frame and that the rotation cleanup works reliably after closing preview playback."

    "context": "The performance type section currently has missing icons and an unbalanced layout. We also need subcategories for each main category and allow multi-select options.",
    "goals": [
      "Fix the layout of the performance type grid so that icons and labels are centered, evenly spaced, and visually balanced.",
      "Ensure all 6 main performance categories display their icons natively using Flutter's built-in Material icons package: Music (Icons.music_note), Dance (Icons.accessibility_new), Visual Art (Icons.palette), Comedy (Icons.theater_comedy), Magic (Icons.auto_awesome), Other (Icons.category).",
      "Bundle icons locally (do NOT rely on CDN links). Ensure icons appear instantly on app load.",
      "Add a clean orange section header 'Performance Type' and a subtle divider below it.",
      "Allow users to select multiple performance types (multi-select chips or toggles).",
      "When a main category is selected (e.g., 'Dance'), show a collapsible subcategory list with at least 7 global subcategories. Users can select multiple subcategories or just the main one.",
      "Save all selected categories and subcategories in the user's Supabase profile under `performance_types` as an array of strings.",
      "Display the user's selected performance types/subcategories on the Performer Profile page — right below the bio and above the supporter/videos row.",
      "Keep all fonts consistent with the app theme. Avoid oversized text.",
      "Improve visual polish — add rounded cards, consistent spacing, and hover/tap feedback."

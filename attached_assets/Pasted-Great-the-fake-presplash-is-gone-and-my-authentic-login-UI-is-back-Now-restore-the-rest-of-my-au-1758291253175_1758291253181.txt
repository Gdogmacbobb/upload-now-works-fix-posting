Great — the fake presplash is gone and my authentic login UI is back. 
Now restore the rest of my authentic UI with these requirements:

1. Supabase Authentication:
   - Verify login is wired to my real Supabase project.
   - In login_screen.dart → onPressed must call Supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() with email/password.
   - Ensure Supabase.auth.currentUser is returned after successful login.
   - If login fails, show inline error messages in the login form.

2. Role-Based Registration Differences:
   - Restore performer vs New Yorker registration flows.
   - Performers must have these fields:
       • Stage Name  
       • Type of Performance (dropdown: Musician, Dancer, Poet, Comedian, etc.)  
       • Bio / About Me  
       • Profile Photo Upload  
   - New Yorkers must have these fields:
       • Username / Handle  
       • Interests (multi-select tags)  
       • Location  
   - Store account_type in Supabase user metadata.
   - After registration, route Performers → performer_profile.dart and New Yorkers → user_profile.dart.
   - UI for these two flows must be visually different, not identical.

3. Performer Profile:
   - Must include an **Edit Profile button** (top-right).
   - Show Stats (Followers, Videos, Supporters).
   - Display videos grid below profile header.
   - Orange accent elements (#FF8C00).

4. New Yorker Profile:
   - No edit button.
   - Show “Community” button instead of Camera in nav.
   - Profile has simpler stats (Following, Reposts, Liked).

5. Bottom Navigation (3 tabs only):
   - Tab 0: Search / Discovery Feed  
   - Tab 1: Camera (Performers only) or Community (New Yorkers only)  
   - Tab 2: Profile (routes to Performer Profile or New Yorker Profile depending on account type)  
   - This must be enforced dynamically by account_type.

6. Preserve All Authentic UI Elements:
   - Dark theme background (#121212) with orange (#FF8C00) accents.
   - Statue of Liberty splash screen + “WE OUTSIDE” branding.
   - Role-based navigation differences.
   - Support Performer flow with payment buttons.
   - Video upload/recording restricted to Performers only.
   - Repost button + New Yorker-only repost tab in profile.

⚠️ DO NOT overwrite Supabase configs, .env, database, or dataset. 
Only fix authentication wiring, restore role-specific registration, and reapply my authentic UI edits.

# Overview

YNFNY is a cross-platform Flutter mobile application designed as a social platform for street performers. It integrates multiple AI services (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Perplexity), Supabase for backend services, and Stripe for payment processing. The project aims to provide a robust and engaging platform for street artists to connect with their audience and monetize their performances, supporting both mobile and web deployment.

**Current Status** (Oct 9, 2025): ‚úÖ **REPLIT SANDBOX FALLBACK IMPLEMENTED** - Added HtmlElementView fallback for video preview in Replit development sandbox while preserving GPU-accelerated rendering in production.

## Recent Video Preview Fixes (Oct 9, 2025)

### Video Preview Orientation & UI Controls (Latest - Oct 9, 2025)
- **Portrait Orientation Fix**: Automatically detects landscape videos and applies 90¬∞ rotation to display upright in portrait mode
- **Dual-Path Rotation**: 
  - **Normal VideoPlayer**: Uses Flutter Transform.rotate with dimension swap for GPU-accelerated rotation
  - **HtmlElementView Fallback**: Applies CSS `transform: rotate(90deg)` with `width: 100vh, height: 100vw` for Replit sandbox
- **Close Button**: Fixed positioning (top: 12px, right: 12px), 32√ó32px size, rgba(0,0,0,0.6) background, centered 20px white X icon
- **Video Pause on Close**: Calls `controller.pause()` before `Navigator.pop()` to cleanly stop playback
- **Rotation Logging**: Console logs "üé• Video rotated to portrait" when rotation is applied (both normal and HtmlElementView modes)
- **Close Logging**: Console logs "‚ùå Preview closed" when user taps close button
- **Complete Flow**: Detect orientation ‚Üí Apply rotation (CSS or Transform) ‚Üí Log rotation ‚Üí User taps close ‚Üí Pause video ‚Üí Log closure ‚Üí Dismiss

### Replit Sandbox Fallback with HtmlElementView (Oct 9, 2025)
- **Sandbox Detection**: Checks `window.location.hostname` for 'replit' in initState to identify development environment
- **Platform View Fallback**: Uses `ui_web.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory()` to create raw `<video>` element that bypasses Flutter compositor entirely
- **Conditional Rendering**: In Replit sandbox: renders `HtmlElementView` instead of `VideoPlayer`; in production: uses normal GPU-accelerated `VideoPlayer`
- **Warning Overlay**: Displays orange container with "‚ö†Ô∏è Video preview limited in development sandbox. Works perfectly on deployed builds (Firebase, Netlify, Vercel)" only in sandbox mode
- **Mobile Build Safety**: Created `ui_web_stub.dart` with conditional import pattern to prevent dart:ui_web compilation errors on iOS/Android
- **Auto Paint Confirmation**: Sets `_paintConfirmed = true` when using HtmlElementView fallback, bypassing compositor checks
- **Production Behavior**: Zero performance impact on deployed builds - fallback never activates outside Replit environment
- **Complete Fallback Flow**: Hostname check ‚Üí Register platform view factory ‚Üí Render HtmlElementView ‚Üí Show warning ‚Üí Paint ‚úÖ

## Previous Video Preview Fixes (Oct 8, 2025)

### Hardware Compositing & Cross-Origin Fix (Latest - Oct 8, 2025)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Forces hardware compositing with `willChange`, `transform: translateZ(0)`, `backfaceVisibility: hidden`, `perspective: 1000px`, `mixBlendMode: normal`
- **Cross-Origin Safety**: Sets `crossOrigin='anonymous'` to prevent video texture rejection when blending with Flutter's WebGL layer
- **Smart Paint Detection**: Finds VISIBLE video element (first with non-zero bounding box) instead of always using first DOM element
- **Compositor Verification**: Logs computed opacity and transform values to confirm GPU compositing is active
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Detects when video has dimensions but compositor blocks blending - logs "Hardware compositor or sandbox blocked HTML video blending"
- **Complete Flow**: DOM detected ‚Üí Apply GPU acceleration + CORS ‚Üí Find visible video ‚Üí Verify compositor ‚Üí Paint ‚úÖ

### Hard Dimension Forcing Fix (Oct 8, 2025)
- **Explicit Sizing Fix**: Sets both HTML attributes (`video.width`/`height` = viewport pixels) AND CSS (`100vw`/`100vh`) to force browser allocation
- **Forced Reflow Sequence**: `pause()` ‚Üí read `offsetHeight` (triggers synchronous layout) ‚Üí `play()` to commit dimensions
- **Style Lifecycle**: Saves and restores maxHeight, objectFit, backgroundColor in addition to previous styles

### Renderer Verification & Visual Debugging
- **Explicit HTML Renderer Mode**: Added `<meta name='flutter-web-renderer' content='html'>` to web/index.html to force HTML renderer
- **Runtime Renderer Detection**: Checks `window.flutterWebRenderer` and logs active mode ("html", "canvaskit", or "unknown")
- **Visual DOM Debugging**: Injects lime outline (`4px solid lime`) on video elements with bounding rect logging for visual confirmation
- **Fallback Warning Overlay**: When paint check times out, displays orange warning in debug overlay showing renderer mode and compositing failure
- **Complete Debug Flow**: DOM detected ‚Üí Detect renderer ‚Üí Apply lime outline ‚Üí Log bounds ‚Üí Poll paint ‚Üí If timeout: Show "‚ö†Ô∏è Renderer: [mode] - Video not composited"

### Full-Screen Rendering Fix with Style Restoration
- **Fixed Positioning with Viewport Units**: Uses `position: fixed` (not absolute) with `100vw/100vh` to completely detach video from Flutter layout and force full-screen rendering
- **Parent Overflow Reset**: Clears `overflow: hidden` on body/html/flt-glass-pane to prevent clipping
- **Style Lifecycle Management**: Saves all original CSS before modification, restores in dispose() to prevent persistent full-screen video after dialog closes
- **Paint Polling Verification**: Retries `getBoundingClientRect()` every 200ms until browser reports non-zero dimensions (timeout: 3 seconds)
- **Complete Fix Flow**: DOM detected ‚Üí Save original styles ‚Üí Reset parent overflow ‚Üí Apply fixed position with viewport sizing ‚Üí Playback starts ‚Üí 150ms delay ‚Üí Pause/play repaint ‚Üí Poll bounding rect ‚Üí Paint confirmed ‚Üí On dialog close: Restore all original styles

### Paint Visibility Enforcement
- **CSS Visibility Enforcement**: After DOM detection, explicitly sets `visibility='visible'`, `opacity='1'`, `display='block'` on all video elements to override hidden styles
- **Paint Refresh Sequence**: 150ms delay after CSS changes, then pause/play cycle in postFrameCallback to force browser texture repaint
- **Enhanced Debug Overlay**: Added "Paint ‚úÖ/‚ùå" indicator (web-only) to confirm video texture has dimensions

### DOM Visibility Detection
- **Cross-Platform Stub Pattern**: Created `web_dom_stub.dart` with Document/ElementList stubs for mobile builds, conditional import switches to real `dart:html` on web
- **Direct DOM Access**: Replaced eval() with `html.document.getElementsByTagName('video').length` for CSP-safe checking
- **Retry Logic**: Polls every 200ms for up to 3 seconds (15 attempts) to detect when HTML `<video>` element attaches to DOM
- **Dynamic Texture Refresh**: ValueKey based on timestamp forces texture layer recreation on timeout

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses Flutter for a single codebase across mobile and web. Key features include:
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure management of environment variables via `env.json` and `--dart-define-from-file`.
- **Video Recording & Upload**: TikTok/Reels-style UI for vertical video recording and a modernized upload screen, optimized for quality and cross-platform compatibility. This includes full-screen preview, portrait lock, maximum resolution, responsive controls, pinch-to-zoom, and platform-safe video controllers.
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Mobile-only feature using `video_thumbnail` for generating 8 preview frames; web displays a "not available" message.
- **Null Safety**: Extensive use of nullable types, FutureBuilder patterns, and `mounted` checks for robust camera/video controller management.
- **UI/UX**: Focus on a polished, intuitive user experience, especially for video recording interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Single codebase with platform-specific adaptations where necessary.

## Backend Architecture
A serverless approach using external services:
- **Supabase Integration**: Primary BaaS for authentication, database, and real-time features.
